# Setup

## Requirements

- Xcode 13+
- Swift 5.5+
- iOS 14.0+


Install the latest version of Xcode from the App Store or Apple Developer Download website. Also, we assert you have the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) package manager.  

This guide may not suit your machine and actually setup procedure may change in the future. Please file the issue or Pull Request if there are any problems.

## CocoaPods
The app use [CocoaPods]() and [Arkana](https://github.com/rogerluan/arkana). Ruby Gems are managed through Bundler. The M1 Mac needs virtual ruby env to workaround compatibility issues. Make sure you have [Rosetta](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861) installed if you are using the M1 Mac.

#### Intel Mac

```zsh
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

#### M1 Mac

```zsh
# install the rbenv
brew install rbenv
which ruby
# > /usr/bin/ruby
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.zprofile
source ~/.zprofile
which ruby
# > /Users/mainasuk/.rbenv/shims/ruby

# select ruby
rbenv install --list
# here we use the latest 3.0.x version
rbenv install 3.0.3
rbenv global 3.0.3
ruby --version
# > ruby 3.0.3p157 (2021-11-24 revision 3fb7d2cadc) [arm64-darwin21]

gem install bundler
bundle install
```

## Bootstrap

```zsh
# make a clean build
bundle install
bundle exec pod clean

# setup arkana
# please check the `.env.example` to create your's or use the empty example directly
bundle exec arkana -e ./env/.env

# clean pods
bundle exec pod clean

# make install
bundle exec pod install --repo-update

# open workspace
open Mastodon.xcworkspace
```

The Arkana plugin will setup the push notification endpoint. You can use the empty template from `./env/.env` or use your own `.env` file. To setup the push notification. Please check section `Push Notification` below.

The app requires the `App Group` capability. To make sure it works for your developer membership. Please check [AppSecret.swift](../MastodonSDK/Sources/MastodonCore/AppSecret.swift) file and set another unique `groupID` and update `App Group` settings.

#### Push Notification (Optional)
The app is compatible with [toot-relay](https://github.com/DagAgren/toot-relay) APNs. You can set your push notification endpoint via Arkana. There are two endpoints:
- NotificationEndpointDebug: for `DEBUG` usage. e.g. `https://<your.domin>/relay-to/development`
- NotificationEndpointRelease: for `RELEASE` usage. e.g. `https://<your.domin>/relay-to/production`

Please check the [Establishing a Certificate-Based Connection to APNs
](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/establishing_a_certificate-based_connection_to_apns) document to generate the certificate and exports the p12 file.

Note: 
Please check and set the `notification.Topic` to the app BundleID in [toot-relay.go](https://github.com/DagAgren/toot-relay/blob/f9d6894040509881fee845972cd38ec6cd8f5a11/toot-relay.go#L112). The server needs use a reverse proxy to port this relay on 443 port with valid domain and HTTPS certificate.

#### Spell Checking (optional)
To set up spell checking in Xcode, go to Edit → Format → Spelling and Grammar → Check Spelling While Typing. This will help you avoid typos while coding.

Additionally, the Node.js-based tool [CSpell](https://cspell.org) is used in CI and can be used locally to check spelling in the project. If you have Node.js installed, you can run `npm install` and `npm test` to check spelling in the project. If a word you’ve introduced into the project is incorrectly marked as misspelled, add it to one of the text files in the `.cspell` (see the comments at the top to understand what each file contains). If the name you’re using corresponds to a new SF Symbol, run `node .cspell/make-sf-symbols.mjs` for instructions on how to update the list of words in SF Symbol names.

## Start
1. Open `Mastodon.xcworkspace` 
2. Wait for the Swift Package Dependencies resolved. 
2. Check the signing settings make sure to choose a team. [More info…](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev23aab79b4)
3. Select `Mastodon` scheme and device then run it. (Command + R)

We welcome contributions! And if you have an interest to contribute codes. Here is a document that describes the app architecture and what's tech stack it uses.
